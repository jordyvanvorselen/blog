I am a software engineer specialised in designing, testing and crafting high quality software solutions. I love finding elegant solutions to complex problems
and helping development teams take the step to the next level by embracing a culture of best practices.

On this blog I will write about all the things I care about that are related to software engineering. I'm a high test coverage, clean software architecture and open-source fanatic. I strive to deliver *beautiful* code.

Most of my time is spent helping companies solve critical problems by designing and building robust software solutions. My previous work ranged from short assignments to
multi-year projects for some of the largest enterprise companies of the Netherlands - like Signify or ASML.

When not busy coding, I can be found lifting weights üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or playing guitar :guitar:.
