I am a software engineer specialised in designing, testing and crafting high quality software solutions. I love finding elegant solutions to complex problems
and helping development teams take the step to the next level by embracing a culture of best practices.

High test coverage, software architecture and open-source fanatic. Strives for *beautiful* code.

In my career I help companies solve critical problems by designing and building robust software solutions. My previous work ranged from short assignments to
multi-year projects for some of the largest enterprise companies of the Netherlands - like Signify or ASML.

When not busy coding, I can be found lifting weights üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or playing guitar :guitar:.
