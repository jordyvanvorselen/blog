I am a software engineer specialised in designing, testing and crafting high quality software solutions. I love finding elegant solutions to complex problems
and helping development teams take the step to the next level by embracing a culture of best practices.

High test coverage and software architecture fanatic. Strives for *beautiful* code.

In my career I have helped solve critical problems for many different companies by building robust software solutions. The work ranged from very small short
assignments to multi-year projects for some of the largest enterprise companies like Signify or ASML.

When not busy coding, I can be found lifting weights üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or playing guitar :guitar:.
