#### Examining the lake

You are standing in front of a giant lake, with your swimming pants on. Next to you stand three of
your colleagues in similar attire. The fact that you're all wearing swimming pants is quite obvious,
as us engineers like to swim more than to talk. Engineers are always prepared to dive in, no matter
the circumstances. It's what we excel at.

But next to the group stands your project manager, dressed in a suit. He obviously does not really
like to swim, but likes to talk and make decisions instead.

And he asks your team the following question:

> "How cold is the water?"

You don't really understand how important this question is to him, so you quickly shrug your
shoulders in a nonchalant fashion and tell him it's probably quite cold. Somewhere around 5 degrees
Celsius, you say. Could also be a bit colder, or a bit warmer, but somewhere around 5.

Your manager responds:

> "I need something more specific. I can't sell this to my stakeholders."

You now start to get annoyed a bit, and tell him you just magically come up with a better
estimation. We _estimate_ because we cannot predict the future precisely. It's the best tool we've
got. We're not able to measure this precisely. Just communicate the estimate, it's the _best we can
do_. Measuring water is hard, and you will _always_ be wrong.

> "This swim will be so important, that we will have to do it **no matter what**. This is why we
> need to know _exactly_ what the temperature is. We can't report these kind of approximate
> estimations."
>
> "Can't you just examine the water again? Maybe it will end up to be warmer this time."

Completely dumbfound because of what you just heard, you turn back to the lake. Guess the swim will
have to be delayed a bit. Not sure of what to do, you turn back to your team. Guys, how can we get a
better estimate of the temperature? This project is _very important_, and we will have to do it no
matter what.

Some team members stick their hands in the water. Some people even walk around on their bare feet in
the undeep water to get a better feel for it. Feeling a bit pressured to end up higher, you all give
your best-case estimates of the temperature.

As the lead you take the average to report back to the manager.

> "Hmm see, now we ended up with 7 degrees Celsius. That's not too cold. Way better than 5. If you
> want, you guys can start swimming now."

So you and your colleagues jump in the lake, relieved you can go back to swimming. And as is always
the case, the temperature turned out to be lower. 2 degrees Celsius. You complete the swim, come
back out and everyone is kind of happy - even though it turned out to be a bit colder than expected.
Even the manager and the stakeholders are happy the swimming is over. Everyone now finally has what
they so eagerly waited for.

And after this, the manager says:

> "Let's have a retrospective. We are happy, the stakeholders are happy, but the estimate turned out
> to be quite a bit different from reality."
>
> "It's important to analyze what went wrong there."

And so you all gather around the lake once again, still wearing the swimming pants, and start
_talking_.

#### The retrospective

In the retrospective one of the engineers has thought about this whole process. He asks the
following question: "As we knew we had to complete the swimming **no matter what**, why did we waste
so much time standing around the lake beforehand? We knew we had to jump in eventually, anyway."

The manager responds:

> "We need good planning. And to achieve that, we need good estimations."

"Why can't we just start with the most important task and give an estimate after a while? After
being in the water for a while we would have had a _way better estimate_ of the temperature. And the
planning seldom changes because of our estimates!"

> "It's not how our process works. The custo..."

You're starting to feel tired and just want to dive into the unknown.

_But the next time, you gather 'round the lake, once again._
