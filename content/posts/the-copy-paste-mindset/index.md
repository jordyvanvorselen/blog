As we head towards the end of the year, an idea that has been lingering with me for quite a while
sprang right back into my mind. I could never fully grasp it, feel it, or articulate it correctly.

But today - one day after a presentation about HTMX by one of my colleagues - it finally _clicked_.

#### The box

Throughout history we have become more technologically advanced. In recent years, the consumption of
content in all its forms have reached its peak. All but the oldest people in society are consuming
content in one way or another. Some of us consume the most obvious forms of content like being on
TikTok or Instagram, while others consume content like certain podcasts, forums or books. Most of it
is related to one certain subject, one certain niche. So much that we, unconsciously, begin to
_identify_ with it.

The funny thing is that we tend to despise “the other side”, while simultaneously _doing the same
thing_ - but just a tad differently.

Because of this, many of us have been slowly developing a copy-paste mindset. It starts to become
visible, as what we _consume_ impacts everything we _produce_. People unconsciously categorize
themselves into subcategories and everyone in those subcategories read, think and look the same. But
not _exactly_ the same. It's kind of similar to equality
[in JavaScript](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJo92.png).

#### Out of bounds exception

This categorizing everything into strict borders that should not be crossed does not stop at the
content we consume. This is exactly the current trend in software engineering. Instead of merely
being proficient software engineers, we now categorize ourselves into increasingly narrower
categories. We all cling to our increasingly smaller niches. We went from being software engineers,
to frontend/backend engineers, to React Developer. We focus on information about a very specific
niche and often fail to look beyond the borders of our niche. And to keep our precious job titles as
specific as possible we welcome complexity.

> helps our customers!

It is a bullshit idea we’re now [slowly coming back](https://htmx.org/) from, tail between legs.

#### The goal of software engineering

Why are we, as a community of engineers, not thinking about _delivering value_ as our first priority
anymore? Where is the so needed curiosity to learn new things you know _nothing_ about, instead of
iterating on the same old problems using slightly different solutions?

Have we all slowly creeped into a fixed mindset?

What’s stopping us from learning about servers, other languages, hosting, cloud, frontend, backend,
CSS, animations, design or software architecture - all at the same time? We have the best learning
materials ever available at the tips of our fingers, often for free. Stop identifying with your
precious framework or programming language. Learn from concepts and languages you _have yet to
learn_. From the people you currently think are crazy. From those you think you disagree with.

Because it’s all going to pass. Your cherished library, framework, or language _will_ be replaced.
The only thing that will stay the same are the concepts you learned on the way.

And there will always be a maximum amount of useful concepts you can learn in a single niche.

Don’t allow yourself to be enslaved to one niche, because _only_ then you can’t be copy-pasted when
the moment of _real change_ arrives.
