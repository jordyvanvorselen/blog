As we head towards the end of the year, an idea that has been lingering with me for quite a while
sprang right back into my mind. I could never fully grasp it, feel it, or articulate it correctly.

But today - one day after a presentation about HTMX by one of my colleagues - it finally _clicked_.

#### The box

Throughout history we have become more technologically advanced. In recent years, the consumption of
content in all its forms have reached its peak. All but the oldest people in society are consuming
digital content in one way or another. Some of us consume the most obvious forms of content like
being on TikTok or Instagram, while others consume content like certain podcasts, forums or books.
Most of it is related to one certain subject, one certain niche. So much that we, unconsciously,
begin to _identify_ with it.

The funny thing is that we tend to despise “the other side”, while simultaneously _doing the same
thing_ - but just in a slightly different way.

Because of this, many of us have unknowingly been developing a copy-paste mindset. It's hidden in
plain sight, but visible, as what we _consume_ impacts everything we _produce_. People unconsciously
categorize themselves into subcategories and everyone in those subcategories read, think and look
the same. But not _exactly_ the same.

It's kind of similar to equality in JavaScript :wink::

```javascript
[] === []
> false

[] == []
> false

[] == ""
> true
```

#### Out of bounds exception

This categorizing everything into strict borders that should not be crossed does not stop at the
content we consume. This is exactly the current trend in software engineering as well. Instead of
merely being proficient _software engineers_, we now categorize ourselves into increasingly narrower
categories. We all tend to cling to our increasingly smaller niches. We went from being software
engineers, to frontend/backend engineers, to React or Spring Boot Developers. We focus on
information about a very specific niche (often a single language or framework even), which causes us
to fail to look beyond the borders of said niche.

And to keep our precious job titles as specific as possible we welcome complexity.

It is a fundamentally flawed idea that we’re now [slowly coming back](https://htmx.org/) from, tail
between legs. Some of us just don't realize it yet.

#### The goal of software engineering

Why are we, as a community of engineers, not thinking about _delivering value_ as our first priority
anymore? Where is the so needed curiosity to learn new things you know _nothing_ about, instead of
iterating on the same old problems using
[slightly different solutions](https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/)?

Are we, as the engineering community, slowly creeping into a fixed mindset?

What’s stopping us from learning about servers, other languages, hosting, cloud, frontend, backend,
CSS, animations, design or software architecture - all at the same time? We have the best learning
materials ever available at the tips of our fingers, often for free! And then there's people
convincing themselves (or even worse: others) that you can only become really good at one of them
:laughing:.

It's better to stop identifying with your precious programming language or framework. Learn from
concepts and languages you _have yet to learn_. Preferably from people you currently think are crazy
to work or think in a certain way. Learn from those you _think_ you disagree with.

Because it’s all going to pass. Your cherished library, framework, or language _will_ be replaced.
Even Java, C# and Python will become the COBOLs of tomorrow. We just don't know _when_ yet. The only
thing that will stay the same are the concepts you learned along the way.

And there will always be a maximum amount of useful concepts you can learn in a single niche.

Don’t allow yourself to be enslaved to a small niche, because only then you can’t be copy-pasted
when the moment of _real_ change arrives.
